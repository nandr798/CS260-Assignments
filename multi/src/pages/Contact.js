  <h1> Maroon  </h1>
     <p>When the morning came we were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf
'Cause we lost track of time again
Laughing with my feet in your lap, like you were my closest friend
How'd we end up on the floor anyway?
You say, "Your roommate's cheap-ass screw top Ros√©", that's how
I see you every day now
And I chose you
The one I was dancin' with in New York
No shoes, looked up
At the sky and it was
The burgundy on my t-shirt when you splashed your wine onto me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks, so scarlet, it was
The mark you saw on my collarbone, the rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home, so scarlet, it was maroon
When the silence came, we were shaking blind and hazy
How the hell did we lose sight of us again?
Sobbin' with your head in your hands
Ain't that the way shit always ends?
You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway
Carnations you had thought were roses, that's us
I feel you no matter what, the rubies that I gave up
When I lost you
The one I was dancin' with in New York
No shoes, looked up
At the sky and it was maroon
The burgundy on my t-shirt when you splashed your wine onto me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks, so scarlet, it was
The mark you saw on my collarbone, the rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home, so scarlet, it was maroon
And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fucking legacy that you see (it was maroon)
And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fucking legacy to leave
The burgundy on my t-shirt when you splashed your wine onto me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks, so scarlet, it was maroon
The mark you saw on my collarbone, the rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home, so scarlet, it was maroon
It was maroon
It was maroon

<h1> Labyrinth </h1>
<p>It only hurts this much right now
Was what I was thinking the whole time
Breathe in, breathe through
Breathe deep, breathe out
I'll be getting over you my whole life
You know how scared I am of elevators
Never trust it if it rises fast
It can't last
Uh oh, I'm falling in love
Oh no, I'm falling in love again
Oh, I'm falling in love
I thought the plane was going down
How'd you turn it right around
It only feels this raw right now
Lost in the labyrinth of my mind
Break up, break free, break through, break down
You would break your back to make me break a smile
You know how much I hate that everybody just expects me to bounce back
Just like that
Uh oh, I'm falling in love
Oh no, I'm falling in love again
Oh, I'm falling in love
I thought the plane was going down
How'd you turn it right around
Uh oh, I'm falling in love
Oh no, I'm falling in love again
Oh, I'm falling in love
I thought the plane was going down
How'd you turn it right around
Uh oh, I'm falling in love
Oh no, I'm falling in love again
Oh, I'm falling in love
I thought the plane was going down
How'd you turn it right around
Uh oh, I'm falling in love
Oh no, I'm falling in love again
Oh, I'm falling in love
I thought the plane was going down
How'd you turn it right around</p>

<h1> Bejeweled </h1>
<p> Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind
Didn't notice you walking all over my peace of mind
In the shoes I gave you as a present
Puttin' someone first only works when you're in their top five
And by the way, I'm going out tonight
Best believe I'm still bejeweled when I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band, they ask, "Do you have a man?"
I can still say, "I don't remember"
Familiarity breeds contempt, don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes, I polish up real, I polish up real nice (nice)
Baby boy, I think I've been too good of a girl (too good of a girl)
Did all the extra credit, then got graded on a curve
I think it's time to teach some lessons
I made you my world, have you heard?
I can reclaim the land
And I miss you (I miss you), but I miss sparkling (ah, hey)
Best believe I'm still bejeweled when I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band, they ask, "Do you have a man?"
I can still say, "I don't remember"
Familiarity breeds contempt, don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes, I polish up real, I polish up real nice (nice)
Sapphire tears on my face, sadness became my whole sky
But some guy said my aura's moonstone just 'cause he was high
I went dancin' all night and you can try to change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
What's a girl gonna do? A diamond's gotta shine
Best believe I'm still bejeweled when I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer (shimmer)
And when I meet the band, they ask, "Do you have a man?"
I can still say, "I don't remember"
Familiarity breeds contempt, don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes, I polish up real (nice), I polish up real nice
I went dancin' all night and you can try to change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
What's a girl gonna do? What's a girl gonna do? I polish up nice
Best believe I'm still bejeweled when I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer</p>
